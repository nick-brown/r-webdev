#How do I learn to be a web developer?

There is no easy answer for this, as people have taken very different paths to end up in their careers.  However, a solid foundation usually resides in learning:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (not just jQuery)

In that order.  These three things generally provide the basis for any modern website or application.  From there, you have options.  Jobs will often be broken down into *back-end* and *front-end* developers.  There is no clear delineation between the two, but the general breakdown is:

*Front-end*

* Primarily HTML / CSS / JavaScript use
* Building the part of the site that the user sees
* Sometimes cutting up PSDs (Photoshop files) into smaller, easier to manage images
* Possibility of some design work in Photoshop

*Back-end*

* Primarily writing one server-side language (PHP, Python, Ruby, C#, JavaScript*, and others)
* Building the *behind-the-scenes* code that powers the website and core functionality
* Working with databases to organize, store, and manipulate data (MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and others)
* Often incorporating JavaScript to make fully-fleshed out applications
* Possibility of some DevOps (managing the servers that power websites)

For front-end, supplementing HTML / CSS / JavaScript with knowledge of HTTP, cross-browser inconsistencies, and jQuery will help you down the right path.  

For back-end, read a little about the different language choices and pick one to start with.  You are by no means locked in to your first choice.  Choosing a server-side language will be addressed in another question. 

For places to learn, please check the "Where can I learn X technology" question further down.


#What server-side programming language should I learn first?  
#Should I learn language X or language Y?  
#Is language X better than language Y?

There is no *right* answer here.  The main thing to know is that both good and bad code can be written in *any* of these languages.  Some handle very specific use cases better than others, but when you are first starting out, these cases are much further down the path.  There are other languages than the ones listed here, but these are popular choices.

* PHP - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php) - [Official](http://php.net/) - [Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/php/)
* Ruby - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language) - [Official](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) - [Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/)
* Python - [Wikipedia](http://bit.ly/YKKLv) - [Official](http://python.org/) - [Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/python/)
* C# - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language) - [Official](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/hh341490) - [Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/)
* JavaScript* - [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) - [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) - [MEAN stack](http://blog.mongodb.org/post/49262866911/the-mean-stack-mongodb-expressjs-angularjs-and)

*PHP* has been an old standby of web developers.  It started off as a way to add small pieces of functionality to web pages and has evolved over time into a more mature language.  PHP is a favorite of beginners because it is extremely easy to get up and running.  However, detractors say that because PHP is lacking (at least until recently) many of the stricter programming conventions of other languages that it is easy to learn poor programming habits.  There are likely more tutorials out there for PHP than any other web programming language, so be sure the sources you find are recent.

*Ruby* is a language that borrowed heavily from many other programming languages to give developers choices on the ways they could solve a given problem.  Ruby was massively popularized when the Rails framework came on the public scene around 2005, when it was picked up by many start-ups as the new, "hot", thing.  Many detractors resent Ruby's former attention while others see it as too unstable.  However, Ruby has long-since returned to normal levels of popularity in the past few years and matured into a more typical language.

*Python*, like Ruby, borrowed heavily from other programming languages to develop a unique style.  Where Ruby offers many equal ways to solve a problem, Python is usually more interested in finding one "best" way of completing a task.  Many developers recommend Python as a good starting language for this reason.

*C#* is a Microsoft language that originally closely resembled Java.  C# doubles very easily as a more traditional Desktop application programming language.  Detractors generally dislike C# because it is a part of the Microsoft development ecosystem (along with .NET, Visual Studio, and other technologies) and can not be swapped out with existing workflows as easily as most other languages.

*JavaScript** is a somewhat special case.  While it has historically been used as a client-side (in-browser) language, JavaScript has recently seen a rise on the server-side as well.  There are pros and cons to using it in this manner, just keep in mind that it will differ from the more "traditional" back-end languages and is seen as a relatively cutting-edge technology (when used on the server).  One benefit is that a single language can be used seamlessly to handle complex logic on both the server, and client side.

#What's a good development workflow?
#Tell us about your workflow
#Check out my workflow

This question gets asked constantly and often turns into people just talking about how their workflow is better than someone else's rather than anything constructive.  The lesson is that there is no one correct workflow.  There are hundreds of tools to try - so give some a whirl and find out what works for you.

#What web host should I be using?

#What Text Editor / IDE should I use?

Many developers separate code editors into two categories, IDE and Text Editor.  IDE's are generally targeted at one, specific language, and incorporate a large number of features to help write, debug, and run that language.  Text Editors are generally more lightweight and can be used to write any language, but often lack the more advanced, language-specific features of IDE's.  However, there is no clear line here.  Many IDE's are lightweight and can be used for multiple programming languages, and many text editors can be extended to provide language-specific support.  Another thing to keep in mind is that although many developers are passionate that their particular code editor is superior to all others, the choice really boils down to what you as an individual work best with.  Popular choices include:

*Editors*

* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Coda 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
* [Vim](http://www.vim.org/)
* [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)
* [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
